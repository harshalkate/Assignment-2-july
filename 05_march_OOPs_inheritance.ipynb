    "1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "Ans: Inheritance allows programmers to create the classes that are built upon existing classes, to specify a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors to reuse code and to independently extend original software via public classes and interfaces. "

    "2. Discuss the concept of single inheritance and multiple inheritance, highlighting their differences and advantages.\n",
    "Ans:In the case of single inheritance, the derived class performs the inheritance of a single base class. In this case of multiple inheritance, the derived class can acquire multiple base classes in it. The derived classes can utilize the features that belong to a single base class."

    "3. Explain the terms \"base class\" and \"derived class\" in the context of inheritance\n",
    "Ans:It allows you to define a child class that reuses means (inherits), extends, or modifies the behavior of a parent class. The class whose members are inherited is called the base class. The class that inherits the members of the base class is called the derived class."
